Images, audio, and documents often need to be processed together to provide meaningful insights, yet most RAG implementations focus solely on text. Think automated visual inspection systems understanding both manufacturing logs and production line images, or robotics systems correlating sensor data with visual feedback. These multimodal scenarios demand RAG systems that go beyond text-only processing.</p><p>In this talk, we'll talk about how one can build a MultiModal RAG system that helps solve this problem. We'll explore the architecture that makes it possible to run such a system and demonstrate how to build one using Milvus, LlamaIndex, and vLLM for deploying open-source LLMs on your own infrastructure.</p><p>Through a live demo, we'll showcase a real-world application processing both images and text queries. Whether you're looking to reduce API costs, maintain data privacy, or simply gain more control over your AI infrastructure, this session will provide you with actionable insights to implement MultiModal RAG in your organization.</p>",

By using embeddings, we can train classifiers to detect specific driving competencies. Through an active learning loop, we refine these classifiers, enabling them to label similar scenarios across the entire dataset with high efficiency. This embedding-based approach is both fast and scalable, and it also helps us spot “bad data” clusters, like images with droplets on the lens or scenes from test tracks.</p><p>The presentation will delve into the technical infrastructure behind these tools, from vector databases that enable rapid similarity search to Flyte workflows that orchestrate scalable processing across distributed systems. We’ll also explore how query generation helps bridge the gap in positional awareness within text embeddings, allowing for more precise search across video datasets. Finally, the talk will close with a look toward future possibilities, such as on-device edge filtering, which would use embeddings to reduce storage costs by capturing only the most interesting scenarios in real time.</p><p>Designed for engineers and data scientists, this session provides a deep dive into the power of embeddings and VLMs for labeling and retrieving data at scale, making it possible to unlock insights and drive advancements in autonomous vehicle technology.</p>",

With millions of workflow executions across hundreds of types and over 500 million CPU hours consumed quarterly, costs can skyrocket, and encoding issues can disrupt the streaming experience. The challenge is immense: ensuring the timely delivery of high-resolution encodes, avoiding costly codec bugs, supporting last-moment redeliveries, and identifying bottlenecks before they drain compute resources. How do we navigate this complex system without spiraling into budget and delay disasters? This isn't just about fixing bugs faster anymore. This is connected to observability driving real business value. Imagine instantly knowing the true cost of encoding each movie, or precisely tracking redelivery metrics that directly impact revenue.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We confronted these challenges directly and discovered that traditional observability tools, designed primarily for RPC-style services, were inadequate for media workflows. We required observability at scale to support asynchronous media workflows with long-running tasks. By embracing domain-specific events, distributed tracing, and consistent tagging, we achieved a comprehensive view of our users' workloads.

Row-oriented streaming pipelines often send every event (and every field) over the network, even if consumers only need a fraction of that data. With data volumes skyrocketing in the AI era – where machine learning and real-time analytics consume more data than ever – these inefficiencies become a serious bottleneck. In this talk, we explore a new approach that treats all data as tables, seamlessly integrating streams as continuously updating tables to make streaming more efficient and scalable.</p><p>What you'll learn:<br>Filtering Data at the Source: See how combining Apache Paimon with Apache Arrow (a columnar format) enables predicate pushdown and columnar storage. This allows data to be filtered and pruned at the source, significantly cutting down unnecessary network traffic (often by up to 50%). By avoiding the row-by-row transfer of irrelevant data, we reduce network overhead and boost throughput.</p><p>Unified Batch and Stream Queries: Learn how treating streams as tables lets you run the same queries across static data lakes and live streaming data without special-case code. We’ll discuss how Apache Arrow’s in-memory columnar capabilities, integrated with Apache Paimon’s table format, make it possible to query historical data and real-time events in a unified way. This streaming-lakehouse approach simplifies architecture by using one table-oriented model for both batch and streaming workloads.</p><p>Scalable Pipeline Architecture: Discover strategies for chaining multiple processing jobs (with engines like Apache Flink and even Apache Spark) while maintaining data integrity and low latency. We’ll cover how the open-source FLUSS project serves as a real-time streaming storage layer that works hand-in-hand with Flink. Drawing on real-world use cases – including how Alibaba’s platforms handle massive, continuous data streams – we’ll illustrate how this architecture supports billions of events without compromising performance.<br>This session is designed for data engineers and architects looking to build scalable, cost-effective data pipelines that blend streaming and batch processing. You’ll come away with practical insights into why our data architectures must evolve to support AI-driven demand, and how reimagining streams as tables can simplify your stack while delivering substantial performance gains and cost savings.</p>",

But how does it accomplish such a feat?</p><p>In this keynote, we’ll dive into the intersection of cutting-edge hardware and software innovations that power JWST. From its revolutionary segmented mirror and cryogenic cooling systems to the precision algorithms that process terabytes of data into vivid images of the cosmos. Participants will gain insights into how billions of years worth of data translate to breathtaking images that expand for light years, peaking human curiosity and challenging us all to explore beyond our world.</p>",

This talk will cover our human-centered approach to the next generation of AI and provocations for AI hardware people will actually be excited to use. We'll share our thoughts, from wearable pants you can talk to, to a unique camera that plays back your vibes. We’ll reimagine existing devices - like the “Viewmaster”, along with inventing brand-new devices - like an Olfactory ScentCapture sphere. Join us as we expand our minds, erasing the constraints of today and imagine the form of AI in the future.</p>",
