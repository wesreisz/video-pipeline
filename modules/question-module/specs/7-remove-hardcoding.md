I want to remove these hard coded values. Review @2-secrets.md and the terraform configuration @main.tf . Both of these values should be pulled from dev-video-pipeline-secrets (which is a json file and it contains openai_api_key and pinecone_api_key). You can see a reference of how these are used in the embedding-module. We should follow the same approach. Note: we want to implement the smallest change that works and meets these criteria. Do not implement unit tests yet. Do not abtract into complicated services. To not  use lazy loading to cache. Right now I only want you to focus on removing the hardcoded value from the existing code and retrieving it from teh secret store.
