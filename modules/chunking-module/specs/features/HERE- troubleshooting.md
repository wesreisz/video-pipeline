THis is where we left... we need to rerun this and continue to troubleshoot.

I'll summarize the changes we've made in this troubleshooting session:
Chunking Handler Changes
Updated extract_s3_details function in chunking_handler.py to handle only the direct event format:
Apply to README.md
)
Unit Test Updates
Modified test_chunking_handler.py to remove tests for the records format
Removed sample_eventbridge_records_event fixture
Removed test_extract_s3_details_valid_records_event and test_extract_s3_details_malformed_records_event
Updated test descriptions to reflect the simpler event format
State Machine Definition
The ChunkTranscription state in main.tf was already updated to use the direct format:
Apply to README.md
}
Deployment Attempts
We've run the deployment script multiple times to apply these changes
The CloudWatch logs still show the Lambda receiving events in the old format with records, suggesting that either:
a) The deployment hasn't fully completed
b) There might be a caching issue with the Step Functions state machine
c) There might be another component in the pipeline that's transforming the event format
The core issue appears to be that despite our changes to both the Lambda function and the state machine definition, the events are still being received in the old records format. This suggests we might need to:
Verify the state machine update was successful
Check if there are any other components in the pipeline that might be transforming the event
Consider adding support for both formats temporarily while the transition completes
