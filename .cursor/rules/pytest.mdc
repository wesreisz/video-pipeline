# Pytest Testing Standards

## Overview

This project uses pytest as its exclusive testing framework. All test files must be compatible with pytest discovery and execution patterns.

## Naming Conventions

- All test files must follow this pattern:
  - `test_*.py`
- All test functions within these files must be prefixed with `test_`
- All test classes must be prefixed with `Test`

## Test Directory Structure

- Unit tests should be placed in a `tests/` directory at the same level as the module they're testing
- Integration tests should be placed in `tests/integration/` directory
- End-to-end tests are located in the `tests/e2e/` directory
- Tests that require infrastructure should be placed in `tests/infra/`

## Test Execution

- All tests must be run using pytest
- Use the following command pattern:
  ```bash
  pytest [options] [path_to_tests]
  ```
- Common options:
  - `-v`: verbose output
  - `-xvs`: exit on first failure, verbose, no capture
  - `--cov=<module>`: run coverage on specified module
- To run specific test types:
  ```bash
  # Run e2e tests
  pytest tests/e2e
  
  # Run unit tests only
  pytest tests/ --exclude=tests/e2e --exclude=tests/integration
  ```

## Fixtures and Configuration

- Use pytest fixtures for test setup and teardown
- Place shared fixtures in `conftest.py` files
- Use parametrized tests where appropriate using `@pytest.mark.parametrize`

## CI Integration

- CI pipelines must execute tests using pytest
- Test reports should be generated in JUnit XML format using `--junitxml=report.xml`
- Coverage reports should be generated using `--cov-report=xml`

## Best Practices

- Use assertions rather than `assert` statements where possible
- Group tests by functionality
- Keep tests independent and idempotent
- Avoid mocking unnecessarily
- Use appropriate markers for slow or infrastructure-dependent tests

## Dependencies

- Add test dependencies to `dev-requirements.txt`
- Minimum required packages:
  ```
  pytest>=7.0.0
  pytest-cov>=4.0.0
  ```
