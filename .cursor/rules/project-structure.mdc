# Video Pipeline Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

## Root Directory Structure

- `infra/`: Infrastructure as code
  - `modules/`: Reusable infrastructure modules
  - `environments/`: Environment-specific configurations

- `projects/`: Individual service implementations
  - `transcribe-module/`: Service for transcribing audio files

- `libs/`: Shared libraries and code
  - `base/`: Base libraries used across projects

- `samples/`: Sample media files for testing
  - Contains sample audio files (e.g., sample.mp3)

- Configuration files:
  - `pip-requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
  - `dev-requirements.txt`: Development-specific Python dependencies
  - `.gitignore`: Git ignore patterns

This structure follows a modular design pattern where:
1. Services live in `projects/`
2. Infrastructure is defined in `infra/`
3. Shared code is in `libs/`
4. Sample data for testing is in `samples/`
