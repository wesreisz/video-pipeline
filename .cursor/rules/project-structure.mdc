# Video Pipeline Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

## Root Directory Structure

- `infra/`: Infrastructure as code
  - `modules/`: Reusable infrastructure modules
  - `environments/`: Environment-specific configurations

- `modules/`: Individual service implementations
  - `chunking-module/`: Service for chunking the transcriptions
  - `transcribe-module/`: Service for transcribing media files
  - `embedding-module/`: Service for creating embeddings and storing them in pinecone

- `samples/`: Sample media files for testing
  - Contains sample audio files (e.g., sample.mp3)

- Configuration files:
  - `pip-requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
  - `dev-requirements.txt`: Development-specific Python dependencies
  - `.gitignore`: Git ignore patterns

This structure follows a modular design pattern where:
1. Services live in `modules/`
2. Infrastructure is defined in `infra/`
3. Sample data for testing is in `samples/`

Each modules should be structured:
- <name>-module
  - docs
  - specs - llm prompts
  - src - source code
    - handlers
    - models
    - services
    - utils
  - tests
